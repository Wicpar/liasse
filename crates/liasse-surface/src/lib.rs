//! Surfaces: named external API entries, roles, authentication, sessions,
//! clients, and live-view coherence (SPEC.md Part II, §10–12).
//!
//! This crate is the external interface over the runtime [`Engine`]. It routes a
//! client's dotted call/watch through the model's *exposed* surfaces only,
//! authenticates and gates by role, drives live subscriptions with coherent
//! patches, and deduplicates operations by identifier — all as plain owned state
//! over the engine's public admission and view API.
//!
//! # Layering
//!
//! - **Resolution** ([`SurfaceRouter`], [`SurfaceAddress`]) — a dotted address
//!   resolves through the exposed public/role surfaces only; an internal or
//!   unexposed name is [`SurfaceOutcome::Denied`] `Unresolved` (§10.1, §12.1).
//!   A [`SurfaceRouterBuilder`] re-validates every binding against
//!   [`liasse_model::Model::surfaces`], so only exposed, declared members route.
//! - **Authentication** ([`Authenticator`], [`SessionAuthenticator`], [`Role`])
//!   — an authenticator verifies a credential and resolves an actor/session
//!   against committed state; a role gates by accepted authenticator (§11.4) and
//!   membership re-evaluated at admission (§10.3). Session expiry is judged
//!   against the engine's virtual clock (§11.7).
//! - **Clients** ([`SurfaceHost`], [`Connection`], [`Watch`]) — a connection
//!   owns its subscriptions and a frontier; a successful call advances that
//!   frontier through at least the returned commit and drags every still-
//!   authorized subscription through it, delivering coherent patches over the
//!   engine's [`liasse_runtime::ViewDelta`] primitive (§12.2–§12.6).
//! - **Operations** ([`OperationLog`]) — a retained record per scoped identifier
//!   provides at-most-once execution: an equivalent retry re-observes the stored
//!   outcome, a divergent reuse is rejected (§12.3).
//!
//! # Documented seams
//!
//! The model validates surface/authenticator declarations but retains neither
//! the `$mut`→mutation wiring nor the executable `$verify`/`$members`/`$actor`
//! expressions (`crates/liasse-model/src/{surface,auth}.rs` leave those as later
//! passes). This layer supplies those seams as explicit host wiring — a
//! [`Verifier`] for `$verify`, a [`RowSource`] for `$session`/`$actor`/
//! `$members` — validated against the model's exposure boundary.
//!
//! Bounded windows ([`Window`], §12.2 `$size`/`$anchor`/`$slide`) and
//! resume-from-retained-frontier ([`SurfaceHost::resume`], §12.2) are supplied
//! here as client-side projections over the engine's per-frontier
//! [`ViewResult`]. Following one occurrence *across a rekey* (§12.2), recursive
//! surface coverage (§10.5), scoped-role views nested on rows (§10.3), and
//! bucket-driven temporal frontier observation (§12.2) each need identity or
//! scope-parameterized view evaluation the runtime's flat, key-derived
//! [`ViewResult`] does not yet expose, and are left to the runtime.
//!
