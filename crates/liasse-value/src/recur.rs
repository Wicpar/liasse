//! Period recurrence arithmetic (SPEC.md §14.5, §14.7): advancing a timestamp by
//! a fixed or calendar period, and generating a half-open interval series.
//!
//! A fixed period adds an exact elapsed duration. A calendar period applies its
//! `(years, months, weeks, days)` magnitudes in its declared time zone — so a
//! monthly step lands on the same day-of-month across months of different length.
//! An absent destination day is governed by `overflow` (§14.7/A.4): `clamp` lands on
//! the last valid day of the month, `reject` fails the boundary computation. The
//! exact `time` component is then added. The zone rules come from `jiff`; a build
//! without a configured time-zone database can still advance UTC and fixed
//! periods, and reports a named zone it cannot resolve rather than guessing.
//!
//! [`recurring_intervals`] turns a `[from, series_until)` window plus a repeat
//! period into the consecutive `[bi, bi+1)` intervals of §14.5: boundary `i` is
//! the series anchor advanced by `i × period` (Annex A.4), computed from the
//! anchor rather than chained from the previous — possibly clamped — boundary, so
//! end-of-month anchors survive (Jan 31 monthly clamp -> Feb 28, then Mar 31, not
//! Mar 28). The step must advance strictly, a finite series bound must sit above
//! the start, and an unbounded series is generated only up to a caller-supplied
//! horizon.
