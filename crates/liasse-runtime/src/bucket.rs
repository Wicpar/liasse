//! Bucket temporal activity (SPEC.md §14): a bucketed row is active at instant
//! `t` iff `t` lies in its half-open interval `[from, until)`.
//!
//! A `$bucket` associates a row with a logical interval. The engine's virtual
//! clock supplies the evaluation instant, so ordinary reads and view evaluation
//! expose only the rows active at the clock (§14.1, §14.2): a row leaves every
//! active view at the exact `until` instant (the interval is half-open) yet
//! remains extant until an explicit deletion.
//!
//! # CORE scope
//!
//! Lifecycle buckets over a top-level keyed collection are handled: the short
//! form (`"$bucket": ".expires_at"`, meaning `$until` with `$from` = the row's
//! admission) and the explicit `{ $from, $until }` object whose bounds are
//! `timestamp`/`timestamp?` expressions over the collection row. An omitted or
//! `$created`-defaulted `$from` is treated as "active from creation": a committed
//! row was admitted in the past and the clock only advances, so its lower bound
//! is always satisfied without depending on per-row admission-time storage (a
//! documented seam, since the store records serial positions, not wall-clock
//! creation instants).
//!
//! # Temporal selectors (§14.1–§14.2)
//!
//! The `.$at(t)`/`.$between(a, b)`/`.$all` selectors resolve through
//! [`interval_bounds`]: each bucketed row carries its evaluated `[from, until)`
//! as the `$from`/`$until` structural cells, and [`RuntimeEnv`](crate::env)
//! answers [`Environment::temporal`](liasse_expr::Environment::temporal) by
//! applying §14.1's half-open activity rule to those cells. A bare read of a
//! bucketed collection still yields only the rows active at the clock (via
//! [`is_active`]); a selector re-derives activity from the full extant set, so
//! `.$all` and a back-dated `.$at` observe rows that have already left the active
//! interval (§14.2).
//!
//! # Documented seams
//!
//! Source-backed and recurring buckets (`$source`/`$repeat`, §14.4–§14.6) and
//! bounds that read other root collections need source derivation the CORE
//! materializer does not yet build; recurring calendar periods additionally need
//! period-to-timestamp arithmetic `liasse-value` does not expose.
